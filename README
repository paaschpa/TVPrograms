Section 1: Thanks
	Credit given to smarter people

Section 2: About
	This is a work in progress. Don't assume anything here works.  If it does work, don't assume it's
	well coded.  The main goal of this project is to be an intro into .NET MVC and to learn.  I also 
	heard chicks dig .NET MVC, so that's probably my main reason.

Section 3: What is done 	
	-FNH is wired up and working (or is it?)
	-StructureMap wired up and working (as far as I know)
	-AutoMapper wired up not being used (The 'Auto' in the name is misleading)

Section 3: What needs to be done
	Find smart people to do work for me
	Validation
	Use AutoMapper 'Forms' models to replace Domain Models
	Formatting (need to find creative hippie)
	Implement Edit/Update/Delete
	Create Master/Details using JQuery
	FAQ
	Model Binding
